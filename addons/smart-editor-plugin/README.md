# Smart Editor

Smart Editor is a Godot editor plugin that adds small IDE-style conveniences to the built-in script editor. It focuses on fast selection, local code navigation, call hierarchy, and lightweight refactoring helpers for GDScript.

## Demo

## Features

- Smart expand/shrink selection for GDScript expressions, statements, blocks, function bodies, comments, multiline calls, arrays, dictionaries, and function signatures.
- Highlights stripe, a narrow mark strip beside the script editor scrollbar showing usages of the symbol under the caret in the current file.
- Highlights in the visible editor area for the symbol under the caret.
- Function boundary guides that draw subtle horizontal lines between functions to make indentation-based code easier to scan.
- Call Hierarchy, a lazy dockable view that shows callers of the function under the caret.
- Extract Local Variable for selected expressions.
- Rename Symbol for the symbol under the caret.
- Inline Variable for simple local variable declarations.

## Default Shortcuts

Configurable shortcuts can be changed in `Editor Settings` under `Plugin` -> `Smart Editor`.

### Editor Commands

- `Expand Selection`: `Meta+D` (`Command+D` on macOS)
- `Shrink Selection`: `Meta+Shift+D` (`Command+Shift+D` on macOS)
- `Extract Local Variable`: `Meta+Ctrl+V` (`Command+Control+V` on macOS)
- `Rename Symbol`: `Meta+Ctrl+R` (`Command+Control+R` on macOS)
- `Inline Variable`: `Meta+Ctrl+N` (`Command+Control+N` on macOS)

### Call Hierarchy

- `Show Call Hierarchy`: `Ctrl+Alt+H`
- `Select Call Site`: arrow keys
- `Go to Selected Call Hierarchy Method`: `F4` or double-click
- `Return Focus to Script Editor`: `Esc`

The highlights stripe, visible highlights, and function boundary guides update automatically while editing and can be configured in Editor Settings.

## Editor Settings

Settings are available in `Editor Settings` under `Plugin` -> `Smart Editor`.

### Editor

- `Dialog Width`: width used by Smart Editor dialogs.

### Highlights

- `Stripe Highlights Enabled`: show or hide the right-side highlights stripe.
- `In-Editor Highlights Enabled`: show or hide visible usage highlights.
- `Highlight Color`: background color for highlighted usages.
- `Current Highlight Color`: background color for the current usage.
- `Current Outline Color`: outline color for the current usage.

### Call Hierarchy

- `Enabled`: enable or disable the call hierarchy shortcut and dock.
- `Tree Font Size`: font size used in the call hierarchy tree.
- `Max Nodes`: maximum number of hierarchy nodes to load.

### Function Boundary Guides

- `Enabled`: show or hide function boundary guides.
- `Guide Color`: color for function boundary guide lines.

## Installation

From the Godot Asset Library, install the addon into your project and enable `Smart Editor` in `Project` -> `Project Settings` -> `Plugins`.

For manual installation, copy this folder into your project:

```text
addons/smart-editor-plugin/
```

Then enable `Smart Editor` from the Plugins tab.

## Compatibility

Smart Editor is developed and tested with Godot `4.6.1`. Other Godot `4.6.x` releases may work, but `4.6.1` is the supported version for the first Asset Library release.

## Known Limitations

Smart Editor does not try to be a full semantic refactoring engine. Its refactorings are intentionally lightweight and editor-focused.

- `Rename Symbol` depends on Godot's code analysis service. Undo after a rename with multiple changed locations does not revert the whole rename at once in open files, and it cannot undo changes made to closed files.
- `Call Hierarchy` depends on Godot's code analysis service and groups callers by the enclosing function found in GDScript source text.
- `Extract Local Variable` and `Inline Variable` operate on recognized GDScript text patterns. They do not perform complete semantic analysis.
- Smart selection is based on a custom parser for practical editor selection ranges, not Godot's compiler AST. Some unusual syntax can still need more test cases.
- Highlights are focused on the currently open script, not a project-wide usage view.
